# Introduction to Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform 

## Kubernetes cluster
We need a cluster in order to continue with this workshop.
There are two alternatives here.
We recommend the first alternative.
With the second you must skip the tasks to create build triggers and apply changes to the application code.

### Choose between one of these setups: 
1. [**Set up your own cluster on Google Cloud Platform**](https://linemos.github.io/kubernetes-intro/lidev-introduction-to-kubernetes-cluster).
You will have to register your credit card, but you will not be charged anything for this workshop.

2. [**Authenticate with a service accounte**](https://linemos.github.io/kubernetes-intro/lidev-introduction-to-kubernetes-namespace).
You will use a service account to against a cluster we have already created.


Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
